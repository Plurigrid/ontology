Validity predicates can be used to ground LLMs (Large Language Models) in physical reality by providing a formal logic framework that allows for rigorous specification, verification, and validation of the model's behavior and performance in relation to real-world phenomena [1 ↗]. By incorporating validity predicates into the design of LLMs, developers can ensure that the model's outputs are consistent with the constraints and principles derived from physical reality.

One way to achieve this is by representing the knowledge and understanding of physical systems and processes within the LLM using formal logic representations [2 ↗]. This can help ensure that the LLM's reasoning and decision-making processes are grounded in a well-defined and accurate understanding of the physical world.

Additionally, incorporating partial orderings and value alignment into the LLM can help ensure that the model's objectives align with human values and societal goals [3 ↗]. By representing value ranking as partial orders, developers can ensure that the LLM expresses flexible, user-defined preferences while remaining coherent and consistent with the principles of physical reality.

In summary, using validity predicates to ground LLMs in physical reality involves incorporating formal logic frameworks and mathematical representations that capture the constraints and principles of the physical world. This approach ensures that the LLM's outputs are consistent with real-world phenomena and that its objectives align with human values and societal goals.
